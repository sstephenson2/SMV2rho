# SMV2rho

 SMV2rho is a Python package for converting continental crustal seismic velocities into density.
 It contains modules for doing the following:

 * calculating densities of continental crustal rocks given P- and S-wave velocity profiles using either Brocher's (2005) parametrisation, or a new scheme developed by Stephenson et al (_in review_)
 * calculating the effects of temperature dependence on seismic velocity and density
 * locating seismic velocity profiles that are within a certain distance of one another and comparing data
 * calculating distances between geographic locations
 * calculating uncertainties in crustal density estimates
